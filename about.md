I am Daniel Reusche an independent research engineer in Applied Mechanism Design.

My general interest lies in using techniques from Cryptography, (Privacy Preserving) Machine Learning and Distributed Systems to move research from Mechanism Design towards real world applications.

My current overarching project is to build practical allocation and reputation systems that work robustly under uncertainty. Additional goals are making them usable under strict resource constraints (e.g. bandwidth, computation) and in heterogenous network environments.
